</head>

<!-- 1. Put the dragon on the screen.
2. Give the user instructions that they must fight or flee and a button for each.
3. Instruct the user that if they choose to fight, they must roll a 9 or higher or they will be burnt to a crisp!
4. If they flee, change the image of the dragon to the coward fleeing and mock the user for cowardice!
5. If they choose to fight, they must roll the dice. Update the dice to reflect their roll. Display on the screen what they rolled As well as the outcome.

Bonus
6. Using a while loop, keep the game going as long as each character has hit points. Start the dragon at 20 and the hero at 20. Add a roll for the dragon. Subtract the hit points for each after the "fight" (roll). The while loop should terminate when one member of the fight drops below 0.
Super Bonus
7. Create other options within the game. For instance,
7a. Allow the user one chance in the while loop to "attack with bravery" which will increase the damage done by 4, but will increase damage by 4. 
7b. Allow the user one chance to drink a health potion and increase their health back to 20.
7c. Allow the dragon to randomly get distracted by how shiny the hero's armor is and forget to attack.
7d. As the hero is more wounded, decreases his rolls so he does less damage.
